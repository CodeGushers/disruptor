### Tracking decisions

It has been decided to track important choices in this project, with the help of  Architectural Decision Records (ADRs for short, concept explained [here](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) or [here](https://adr.github.io)). The main intent is to ensure everyone developing the project is well aligned with it's goals, always can quickly get up to speed or propose a new direction.

The ADRs are to be placed in `docs/adrs` directory of this repository and follow conventions described in the [initial adr](docs/adrs/adr-000-using-adrs.md).
